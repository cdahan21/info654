                            <p>The Museum of Modern Art is one of the world's leading museums for modern and
                                contemporary art, featuring works including paintings, sculpture, photography, film, and
                                design. Highlights include pieces by Van Gogh, Picasso, Warhol, and contemporary
                                innovators.

                                <strong>My Review: </strong>This was my first time visiting the main MoMA. It was such a
                                beautiful space and easy to navigate through. The vibes were so amazing and we were able
                                to go for free through UNIQLO Friday Nights (free admission for NY residents). My
                                favorite exhibition was Pirouette: Turning Points in Design. It really emphasized how
                                design is incorporated into everything we do and is a "fundamental element of life." It
                                was so cool to see the original sketch for the "I ❤️ NY" logo in real life after
                                learning of its significance through podcasts a while back. I also really into how they
                                showcased things/objects we see every day like the monobloc chair and head phones;
                                showing how even the most ordinary things are designed with intention. My favorite
                                painting I saw there was The Red Studio by Matisse. Overall it was a lovely evening and
                                I'm excited to return with more time so I can see everything.

                            <p>The Whitney is the only museum dedicated to American art and artists. It has an
                                incredible rooftop overlooking the Hudson River. The views are as impressive as the art.

                                <strong>My Review: </strong>I love the location of this museum and there is so much to
                                do nearby. The views from the balconies on each floor are just as cool as the art. My
                                favorite floor was the 7th, which had the Whitney's Collection: Selections from 1900 to
                                1965. The collection had pieces from Georgia O'Keeffe, Edward Hopper and Rockwell Kent -
                                which were some of my favorites. Definitely want to go back again when they have new
                                exhibits. Entry is free for people 25 and under everyday and free the second Sundays of
                                every month for all.

                            <p>A hidden gem dedicated to the life and work of sculptor and designer Isamu Noguchi. The

                                <strong>My Review: </strong>I've always wanted to go and I finally made it! Super cool
                                fact - it's the first in the U.S. designed and installed by a living artist to showcase
                                their own work. The museum had a very serene atmosphere, especially the sculpture the
                                sculpture garden - which was my favorite part. Also, it's free on the first Friday of
                                every month if you reserve a ticket!

                                beautiful and cool. It was so busy though which was overstimulating but still so fun. We
                                also were able to do pay what you wish as residents which was awesome. Seeing all the
                                folliage in central park through the windows was so so beautiful too.

                            <p>A contemporary art center in Long Island City dedicated to experimental and emerging art.
                                Housed in a historic school building, PS1 features large-scale installations,
                                performances, and avant-garde programming. It operates in partnership with MoMA but has
                                its own identity and curatorial focus.

                                <strong>My Review: </strong>Visited MoMA PS1 in Queens, which is separate from the MoMA
                                in Manhattan. It isn't about showing the big-name pieces like the main MoMA. This place
                                is all about giving room for new, experimental art/artists.The space is super cool, but
                                also kind of eerie, which just adds to the experience. It's in an old public school
                                building from 1892, so the architecture has this really unique, almost haunting feel (I
                                lowkey got scared when there was no one else in the hallways).I visited mainly for the
                                James Turrell site specific installation, Meeting, which was the second Skyspace that he
                                constructed in the US. I went when they first opened during the day time, so none of the
                                ambient colorful lights were turned on in the space. Wish I had gone closer to sunset to
                                get the full experience. There is an uncovered opening in the ceiling so it is only open
                                if weather permits.Not art related, but the cafe there was awesome. I grabbed a latte on
                                the way out after checking out the museum store, and it was a nice chill moment.If
                                you're a New York resident, it's free too, so there's no excuse not to check it out!

                            <p>Lévy Gorvy Dayan is a New York–based modern and contemporary art gallery known for its
                                blue-chip exhibitions, curated programs, and work with major artist estates. The gallery
                                also offers art advisory and appraisal services, supporting collectors through
                                acquisition, estate planning, and collection care.

                                <strong>My Review: </strong>I've been wanting to visit this gallery for so long and I
                                finally got the chance to! It felt like the perfect time to do so with the fall city
                                feeling and halloween decorated upper east side townhomes, which the gallery is situated
                                amongst. The space itself is so beautiful with the brightness from the skylight on the
                                second floor, grand staircase and checkered granite floors on the first floor. One of
                                the current exhibitions, Downtown/Uptown: New York in the Eighties, brought life into
                                the gallery with vibrant colors and the recognizable works of artists like Jean-Michel
                                Basquiat, Guerrilla Girls, Keith Haring and Andy Warhol. I loved the variety of mediums
                                on display, showcasing the breadth of artistic exploration during that time. The gallery
                                was free to enter - I was able to walk right in and explore. Definitely want to visit
                                again for another exhibition.

                            <p>One of New York's most prominent commercial galleries, with several locations in Chelsea.
                                Zwirner represents major contemporary artists and frequently mounts ambitious
                                exhibitions. Galleries are free to visit and often include museum-quality installations.

                                <strong>My Review: </strong>Out of all the art movements ever, the light and space
                                movement is my favorite. Seeing Doug Wheeler's work was so insanely amazing (Doug
                                Wheeler | Day Night Day). I got lucky and was able to enter the exhibit alone, which
                                made my experience exponentially better. The illusion of scale was so mind boggling it
                                was crazy. The room was so intensely white that it felt almost blinding; the light
                                seemed to envelop everything. I had to walk with my hand in front of me because I
                                couldn't identify where the walls ended or how far the space extended. It really felt
                                out of body. In the photos I took, shadows were captured, which made the space appear
                                less purely bright, but in person, it truly was a luminous void. It was also super cool
                                seeing some of Ad Reinhardt's work in real life (Ad Reinhardt |
                                Print-Painting-Maquette). The exhibit included screen printing which he took up later in
                                his career. The 20th street gallery itself is a beautiful building and space, plus it is
                                free which is awesome.

                                <strong>My Review: </strong>The American Museum of Natural History is a classic NYC
                                experience that never disappoints. The dinosaur halls, planetarium shows, and vast
                                cultural exhibits make it easy to spend hours wandering and still feel like you've only
                                scratched the surface. It's educational without being stuffy, visually stunning, and
                                perfect for all ages. Whether you're into science, nature, or just want to feel a sense
                                of wonder, this museum delivers every time.

                                <strong>My Review: </strong>The City Reliquary is one of Brooklyn's most charming hidden
                                gems. It feels like stepping into a living scrapbook of New York, full of quirky
                                artifacts, neighborhood history, and community, made exhibits. It's small, a little
                                eccentric, and completely heartfelt. If you love local history, odd treasures, or
                                anything that captures the spirit of everyday NYC life, this tiny museum is absolutely
                                worth the visit.

                        <p>Even though this isn't in New York City, this museum is a wonderful day trip. It's located
                            along the Hudson River, about 90 minutes from NYC. The train ride there is scenic and Beacon
                            is a fun town to explore. Known for its vast galleries and natural light, Dia Beacon
                            specializes in minimalist, conceptual, and land-art works from the 1960s onward. Many
                            installations are site-specific and monumental in scale.

                            <strong>My Review: </strong>This was one of the most beautiful spaces I've ever been in.
                            Housed in a former Nabisco box-printing facility, the museum was renovated by Dia with
                            artist Robert Irwin (a long-time San Diego resident known for his Light and Space work) and
                            other architects. We learned that the museum is naturally lit, with skylights as the primary
                            light source—originally crucial for factory workers to monitor print quality. Now, it's
                            considered a "daylight museum," with hours adjusted to the changing seasons and sunsets. My
                            favorite installation was Larry Bell's Duo Nesting Boxes (2021), pictured in the first
                            slide. The natural light brought out the vibrant colors, making it feel like the piece was
                            constantly shifting with the environment. The scale of the space and installations was truly
                            incredible. We took the train up to Beacon, NY, which runs along the water (sit on the left
                            side going to the museum from NYC to be on the Hudson side), and there's a free shuttle from
                            the station into town. The visit was so amazing and restorative!
