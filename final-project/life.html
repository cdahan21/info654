   <h1> Favorite Spots</h1>
  <h4>As a South Brooklyn native, I am by the sea year round. Here is where I recoommend the Brooklyn Cyclone's games in the summer after getting some snacks to sneak in from William's Candy Shop a block away. Or, year round take a walk or sit with lunch by the waters of the boardwalk, Sheepshead bay, or Ceasar Bay (even in the winter ocean wind).</h4>

            Prospect Park is Brooklyn's version of Central Park. You can bike or skate on the roads, find or play baseball in the feilds, have a picnic in the day or watch stars at night. The park hosts event, has many walking trails, bridges, and plazas to walk through, and some wate spaces to watch ducks and swans. Nearby the North exit is the main Brooklyn Public Library, The Prospect Park Zoo, the Brooklyn Museum, the Brooklyn Botanical Gardens and Grand Army Plaza.

  <h1>Favorite Spots</h1>
  <h4>NYC tends to have the reputation of not being so kid friendly at night as kids do have a bed-time even in the city that never sleeps. So, below here I have some recommendations for one of my favorite evening activites which kids can participate in, dine-in movie theaters! Dine-in have grown in popularity here in the city. Some theaters even do special showings of older movies. It's a nice step up from a classic movie experience and more casual then a normal dinner out. So adult, kids, and teens can have an even night out experience.
    </h4>
  <h4>My second card here however, is adult only. I feature 3 of my favorite spots for an evening out. Enjoy!</h4>

           Just half a block from Washington Square park, 8th Street Wineceller is a small wine bar with a large selection and appetizers. The vibe is very calm and typically quiet. Exceptions is the summer and weekend. Nearby are also some independent shops and Greenwich Villiage's live music and comedy hubs. I recommend coming by for a slow down in the night or for the start to the night.</p>

            Wiggle Room is a Bar upstairs and night club downstair. They have a classy but also 1970s vibe. Situated in Alphabet City in the Lower East Side, near by are number of other venues for live music, retro feels, for clubbing type feel. You might also find some poetry or art events as the neighborhood is home to artist.

            The North East Coast is where oysters are sourced, New York being a main locations part of that sourcing. Therefore, I suggest getting some while you're here. September-December is oyster season, but you'll find them anytime of year as well. You'll find a lot of places doing oyster happy hours, but Ten Bells is my personal favorite $1 happy hour. Near by is Maria Hernandez Park, some shops, more dessert, and a few club and music venues.
